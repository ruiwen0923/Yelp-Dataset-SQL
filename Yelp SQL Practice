Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10000
ii. Business table = 10000
iii. Category table = 10000
iv. Checkin table = 10000
v. elite_years table = 10000
vi. friend table = 10000
vii. hours table = 10000
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table = 10000
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = 8927 (name)
ii. Hours = 1562
iii. Category = 2643 
iv. Attribute = 1115
v. Review = 8090
vi. Checkin = 493 
vii. Photo = 6493
viii. Tip = 3979
ix. User = 3453 (name)
x. Friend = 10000 (friend_id)
xi. Elite_years = 13 (year)

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
select
name,
review_count
from user
order by(review_count) desc	
		
	Copy and Paste the Result Below:
Gerald
Sara
Yuri		

8. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans?

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:
No, it doesn't correlate. When we observe columns of fans and review_count, we can find that
Sara and Yuri, who are the second and third user that have the most reviews posted, only have 50 and 76 fans.
However, some user who did not post so much still has many fans such as Mimi. I think the postive correlation is 
not obvious. 	

	
9. Are there more reviews with the word "love" or with the word "hate" in them?

Answer:
Yes. There are 1780 reviews with the word “love”, and 232 reviews with word “hate”.
	
SQL code used to arrive at answer:

SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM review 
WHERE text LIKE "%love%" 

SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM review 
WHERE text LIKE “%hate%”
	
	
10. Find the top 10 users with the most fans:

SQL code used to arrive at answer:

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.

i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?
Yes. The result is as following:
+--------------+---------+----------+-------+-----------------------+--------------+
| name         | city    | category | stars | hours                 | review_count |
+--------------+---------+----------+-------+-----------------------+--------------+
| Cabin Fever  | Toronto | Food     |   4.5 | Monday|16:00-2:00     |           26 |

| Cabin Fever  | Toronto | Food     |   4.5 | Saturday|16:00-2:00   |           26 |
| Loblaws      | Toronto | Food     |   2.5 | Monday|8:00-22:00     |           10 |
| Loblaws      | Toronto | Food     |   2.5 | Tuesday|8:00-22:00    |           10 |
| Loblaws      | Toronto | Food     |   2.5 | Friday|8:00-22:00     |           10 |

| Halo Brewery | Toronto | Food     |   4.0 | Saturday|11:00-21:00  |           15 |
+--------------+---------+----------+-------+-----------------------+--------------+
We can see that the business with 2.5 star is opening during 8:00-22:00. Those businesses with 4-5 stars open late than it. 

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
Yes, the business with 2.5 star has less reviews (10) than those have higher star rating.         
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.
No, since each business has different loction.

SQL code used for analysis:

SELECT business.name, 
business.city, 
category.category, 
business.stars,
hours.hours, 
business.review_count 
FROM (business INNER JOIN category 
ON business.id = category.business_id) 
INNER JOIN hours ON hours.business_id = business.id 
WHERE business.city = 'Toronto' 
AND category.category = "Food" 
		
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:
open:
+-------------------+
| AVG(review_count) |
+-------------------+
|     31.7570754717 |
+-------------------+
closed:
+-------------------+
| AVG(review_count) |
+-------------------+
|     23.1980263158 |
+-------------------+	      
Those businesses that are open have more review on average than those are closed.         

ii. Difference 2:
+---------------+---------+
|    AVG(stars) | is_open |
+---------------+---------+
| 3.52039473684 |       0 |
| 3.67900943396 |       1 |
+---------------+---------+         
The business that are open have higher star rating.         
         
SQL code used for analysis:

i.#compute the average review_count for open business.  
SELECT AVG(review_count)
FROM business
WHERE is_open = 1

#compute the average review_count for closed business.  
SELECT AVG(review_count)
FROM business
WHERE is_open = 0

ii.#compute the average stars for open and closed business respectively
SELECT
AVG(stars),
is_open
from business
Group BY(is_open)
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
Study the users who have most fans are likely to receive which feedback: useful, funny, cool.         
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
To study my case, I need the user table from Yelp datasets. I will extract the user names, the numbers of 'useful','funny','cool'
that they received, and the number of fans they have. Then order by descending in fans.                           
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:
+-----------+--------+--------+--------+------+
| name      | useful |  funny |   cool | fans |
+-----------+--------+--------+--------+------+
| Amy       |   3226 |   2554 |   2751 |  503 |
| Mimi      |    257 |    138 |    159 |  497 |
| Harald    | 122921 | 122419 | 122890 |  311 |
| Gerald    |  17524 |   2324 |  15008 |  253 |

+-----------+--------+--------+--------+------+
(Output limit exceeded, 25 of 10000 total rows shown)

I find that users with more fans would receive feedbacks that marked as 'useful'.         
         
iv. Provide the SQL code you used to create your final dataset:
SELECT 
name,
useful,
funny,
cool,
fans
from user
ORDER BY fans DESC
